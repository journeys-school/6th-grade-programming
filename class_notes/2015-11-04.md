# Intro to Git

Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files.

* Clone - A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy
* Commit - A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.
* Remote - This is the version of something that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com.
* Pull - Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them.
* Push - Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository such as GitHub.com.
* Branches - A branch is a parallel version of a repository. (Illustrate Master)
* Pull Requests - Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators.
