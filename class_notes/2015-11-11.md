# Intro to programming

Why Elixir?

1. Elixir has a very clean and easy-to-learn syntax.
2. Doctests - Documentation as test cases
3. It's a functional programming language.

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats *computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions* and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

"...calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) each time"
